### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Tailwind CSS


### Continued development

In our continued development, we aim to refine our color scheming to ensure a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. This will involve a comprehensive study of color theory, user experience design principles, and iterative testing to achieve the optimal color palette for our project.


### Useful resources

- [Tailwind Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - These docs are amazing and highly beginner friendly. They have helped me to understand the simple concepts and classes of Tailwind CSS.

- [Tailwind Elements](https://tw-elements.com/docs/standard/getting-started/quick-start/) - This is an amazing collect of prebuilt elements. We can get the CSS for the elements just by dragging and dropping the elements.
